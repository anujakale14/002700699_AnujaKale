In the context of a university website, HTML and CSS can be used together to create a structured and visually appealing layout for the website. HTML can be used to create the structure of the website, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and different sections. It can also be used to create elements like tables, forms, and images, which can be used to display important information such as course offerings, faculty bios, and news updates. CSS can then be used to control the visual design of the website, such as the colors, fonts, and spacing. It can be used to control the layout of elements on the page, such as position, size and visibility of elements, and can also be used to create hover effects and animations. By using CSS, the University website can have a consistent design and branding throughout the website. In summary, HTML and CSS work together to create a well-structured and visually appealing university website that can display important information and resources to students, faculty, and staff.
